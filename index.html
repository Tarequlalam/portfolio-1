            <p>I thought we will win it easy but nothing comes easy in my life! As you all know I am not in the best physical condition so I let Affan start the race, he was doing really well till the car had a mechanical issue on lap 32 (45th minute) for which he had to come to the pits. The rear differential was damaged as Affan hit a curb unintentionally, mechanics got to work on the car and we lost out on time. 1 hr 5 mins left.</p>
